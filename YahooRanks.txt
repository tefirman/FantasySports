Fantasy football rankings 2021: Top 200 overall players
USA TODAY
Tue, August 24, 2021, 3:22 PM·7 min read
It's never too early -- or too late -- to start preparing for your fantasy football draft. As usual, running backs will dominate the first round, so building your team around a three-down workhorse is a great way to start. As things progress, it's always a challenge to balance receivers and running backs in the early rounds. And then there's the critical issue of how long to wait before picking a quarterback.

Thankfully, there's more than one way to construct a winning team, so a championship is possible no matter which draft slot you have.

FANTASY FOOTBALL CHEATSHEET: Top players for 2021, ranked by position

Here’s how the best players stack up for the 2021 fantasy football season, according to FantasySharks.com. The rankings are based on a 12-team league using a point-per-reception scoring format.

Due to a variety of injuries, Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey played in only three games in 2020. However, he is ready to reclaim his standing as fantasy football&#39;s top overall player this season.
